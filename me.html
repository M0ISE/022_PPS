        My Name Is Jason Moisiadis, I’m 24 Years old and I live in Sydney. I was homeschooled until year 10 by my lovely mother (don’t tell her I said that) then I headed off to high school.

      </p>
      <p class="SpaceBody small">
        After that I decided to be an Electrical Engineer, I like building computers, so why not go and design Micro Processors? Soon enough I realised that although I liked the structure of Maths and the process of Chemistry, the Physics at the core
        of electrical just wasn’t for me; and more importantly I found that I was really missing some kind of creative expression through my work. I realised just how much value I had put into my writing practise in Extension English.
      </p>
      <p class="SpaceBody small">
        Through this searching I discovered the Batchelor of Design Computing at Sydney University. I wanted something that still involved the analytics of the Sciences but had a large scope for creative expression. I honestly had never heard of User
        Experience or Service Design before starting. I’d only had used photoshop once before to make a Minecraft Texture pack when I was like 12 (paint .net was better).
        But I liked coding and being a web programer seemed like a good gig. Soon enough I learned the basics of being a digital designer, Taking photos, editing together product videos, how to do a decent layout inside the magical world of InDesign,
        basic 3D modelling and Fabrication.
        We then learned how to go through a design process and be interactive with how process, Which focused around the double-diamond metaphor. Researching and collecting data to then shrink down into a concise problem statement, to then ideate out
        into a larger space of solutions to then test and refine to find the best solution.
        We had the oprtunity to test out this design process in serval different fields. With a group of other students we designed a new wayfindgin experience for Sydney aquarium. In another we designed an interface for a atoms garden drone. We used
        this approach to design a data visualisation that showed the disparity in the way that the effects of natal dilators were measured by the UN. Lastly we had the change to go a little wild and we created an interactive installation art work
        that was designed to promote connection and reduce loneliness with urban dwellers in dense cities.
      </p>
      <p class="SpaceBody small">
        Through my undergrad degree I found myself coming to understand and see the positive affect that intentional design can have on the world. That through a user centric approach we can make something that we know is needed and solves a real
        problem, rather than just guessing or dictating.
        Equalily important is also coming to the understanding how designing in the wrong way or with the wrong metric in mind is emensly harmful. When designing there needs to a vision or understanding of how our product or experiences fit within
        user’s lifeworld. Otherwise intentionally or else, you could be designning for harm, there is plenty of that in the world without me adding to it through bumbling about.
      </p>
      <p class="SpaceBody small">
        Creating a good product or experience is about balancing the needs of a commercial solution to inherent human dignity each user has within their messy human life.
        That means being okay with sacrefising some profit or engagement on the alter of Good Design.
        But also means that our best UX elements are behind a pay wall.
        It’s about communicating that if the product you’re using is free, then we’re probably using you as a commodity. If that’s not okay with you then here is a paid tier that removes that.
        It’s about be honest and realistic but also a bit aspirational, maybe even utopian at times, because why not?
        It’s about understanding the limits of what you can control and account for. Sometimes things don’t work how we planned them and that’s okay, because what else are going to do?
        It is better to do less things better than more things worse.
        That the perfect design (or list) will always be finished tomorrow.
