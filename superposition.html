        Who is the person that wrote this piece?
        Who is the person that didn't write this piece?
        <br><br>

        How do these people relate to each other?
        <br><br>

        In writing this piece, the author chooses from a set of actions:<br>
        * To sit and write this work.<br>
        * To sit and not write this.<br>
        * To wash dishes instead of this.<br>
        * To wash dishes to work on this.<br>
        * To finish this piece<br>
        * To never finish this piece<br>
        * To watch an NSW Health Press conference and write this piece while not washing the dishes<br>
        * To not watch an NSW Health Press conference and not write this piece while not washing the dishes.
        <br><br>

        In creating this work, they made the choice to both write and not write. In doing so, they have made a piece
        of
        writing.
        Does that make the choice of not writing the work invalid?
        <br><br>

        No.
        <br><br>

        The act of creating a work is a task that possesses a time scale that at once is both finite and infinite. At
        any point,
        the work could be read as complete—If I die after writing these words, then surely the essay is complete and
        has
        found
        an ending—If more words followed the ones that came before these, then that ending hasn't come to pass.
        However,
        the
        possibility of that ending still has added to the whole of the work. In some way, can we say that the
        particular
        ending
        didn't happen when it still affected the whole?
        <br><br>

        In the same way, I could write this essay till the end of time. Redecorating and rephrasing until the sun has
        gone dark
        and my protons decay. It's a cliché to say that "art or writing is never finished, only abandoned", yet it is
        true in
        some tangible way. There are two versions of myself working on this piece. One that will never finish it and
        another who
        abandoned the task after each word is complete.
        <br><br>

        Yet, In a very real sense, these words will cease to flow, solidifying into a piece that I will not work on
        again. I
        will have written my last sentence, edited my last choice of verb, questioned the concept and form, then
        released this
        piece to be read by my lecturer or the public at large. In doing so, haven't I chosen to 'abandon' the work?
        <br><br>

        No.
        <br><br>

        Yet, through being a conscious entity of actions and ideas, these words, these thoughts that are embodied
        through words,
        will be reformed again and again in ways—different, interactions of being and not being as I move and iterate
        with time.
        In doing that, I have chosen to neither 'abandon' the work or write into eternity. To create is to be in a
        superposition
        of creating and not creating, forming constructs as you go, not finished, not stillborn, but a moment of
        necessary
        collapse,
        <br><br>

        Enacting:<br>
        a particle that is…<br>
        or,<br>
        a wave of …
        <br><br>

        Neither one preforming their dichotomy for more than a moment until the necessary superposition resumes. The
        action of
        enacting, becoming, thinking means that the work itself never finish while also being 'abandoned'. It is only
        in
        the act
        of the head-turning back which forces the space between these objects to shrink away, to be one or the other,
        staccato
        iterations that are separated by:
        <br><br>

        thought process,<br>
        or<br>
        work environment,<br>
        or<br>
        beloved partner,<br>
        or<br>
        object/ person made.
        <br><br>

        Each is seen as a stopping point from which the next epoch is made/ or moves against. Yet, in actuality, there
        is an
        infinite number of choices or divisions between each object. Each one real, A turning over of being and not
        being that
        shifts away and towards each object; this is the shape of that necessary superposition. Which forms and takes
        form. That
        is and isn't and is again.
        <br><br>

        In Lindy lee's 2018 work "True Ch'ien", she illustrates the Zen kōan of that same name through a set of ten
        large
        tableaus. The story of The True Ch'ien, is one of a choice being made, of the necessary heartbreak of leaving
        family for
        the sake of love, coming apart in that action, on reflecting with time, coming together again to see that in a
        meaningful way both paths were taken, yet neither can be held above the other. (MCA 2017) In each tableau, we
        see a
        ghostly rendering of the kōan. The illustration visible most clearly in the catching of the light as you walk
        throughout
        the space. Black ink on black paper. A reading of the work taking time to decipher, the materiality of the
        work
        itself
        rejecting a cursory reading. On walking into the space, my first thought was that these were just a set of
        blank
        sheets
        of paper with burnt holes in them, a motif used by Lindy in her piece "End of Time(flowers fall)" (Bullock, p.
        200).
        Yet, walking through the space, you gather glimpses of the narrative, not hidden but difficult to understand.
        The work
        brings you in and forces you to stand close and examine element by element; if you want to understand what is
        going on
        here. They are to be read up close and after, seen through the totality of their narrative. In doing so, Lee
        models the
        practice of the kōan, a story that rejects a cursory understanding, glimpses of meaning that can be found with
        close
        study, while also found through the exploration of it through your entire being. The object of this kōan is
        the
        question
        of who is the True Ch'ien? With the stipulation that you cannot choose one above the other. The nature of the
        kōan
        requires you to take the question into your own life, Who is the true Ch'ien of my life?
        <br><br>

        Looking back at it now all I can see are:<br>
        the things that I made,<br>
        the people I spent time with,<br>
        the ones I loved,<br>
        the pain I felt.<br>
        <br><br>

        And yet, equally so,<br>
        there things I didn’t make,<br>
        people I didn’t know,<br>
        ones that I didn’t love,<br>
        joy I felt.
        <br><br>

        Alongside the choices that I made-and-remember are the ones I did-not-make-and-forgot. Yet, they are equally
        me.
        Knowing
        with time, as you come together again, you find the choices you didn't make, out of sight, they have grown and
        come back
        with a life of their own. One Ch'ien was bedridden while the other was out in love; by the end they are back
        together
        again. The true Ch'ien is neither and both. To be a person in our world is to accept pain and joy; to live
        entirely in
        one is a falsehood; To live in both is just to live. But that isn't the answer. In talking about Lee's work,
        the
        two
        Ch'iens are often said to be representations of her want to honour tradition and the need to be her own
        artist,
        or,
        between her Chinese heritage or her Australian home (Macgregor, p. 45). Often it is phrased as a need for one
        over the
        other; she is constrained by tradition and freed by her own practice, but I think that is a very western
        absolutist
        approach. That we must be one thing or another, to be or not to be, in an awful cliché, but that isn't true.
        It
        treats
        people as binary linear choices that we are or aren't. But somehow, life isn't like that; the choices we make
        effect our
        lives, but equally, the ghost of the actions we didn't take effect us; she doesn't need to be not or the
        other.
        <br><br>

        The title of the last tableau is "Saving the ghost", who is the ghost that needs saving? Neither one is
        presented or
        titled as a ghost before this frame. In the work, we see the two Ch'ien embracing each other. In other
        tellings
        of the
        story, the two become united together again as one being. Yet, In the tableau and her retelling of the story,
        Lee omits
        that part of the kōan. In doing so, she removes the obvious reading, that the one at the end is the True
        Ch'ien,
        the one
        that is the amalgamations of either; the Lee that can both honour tradition and be her own art. The ghost is
        the
        true
        Ch'ien, the one who is neither and both. The spirit that has lived with her husband and made a family, and the
        one who
        lived in anguish without her love, and the one who experienced both, the one who experienced neither, the
        superposition
        of all options know and unknown. Or at least I think so; in reality, there isn't a True Ch'ien, just like
        there
        isn't a
        true Jason or a true Lee.
        <br><br>

        Yes, I wrote this piece, but in doing so, could I then say that I was the True Jason for doing so?
        <br><br>

        No.
        <br><br>

        There could be another Jason who didn't write this, who was in bed, in pain, half-dead as the world moved by
        and
        time
        passed. He who wrote knows that He who did not is necessary, that if there wasn't pain in inaction, then there
        wouldn't
        be a need for action. Likewise, he who did not write knows that there is one who did write, one that found
        pain
        in his
        pleasure of inactivity and moved against that. But isn't there also a He who Wrote and Didn't write? One that
        did and
        didn't enact the actions available. Through her exploration of the Zen kōan, Lee invites us into uncertainty,
        to
        know
        with certainty that both are true and false, and in saying so, one must be while the other cannot be. Yet
        neither will
        be. The work gives us a glimpse of the sublime that is etched lightly onto all artwork, that fractional
        element
        that
        brings it into the universal (Chan 2009). Which makes art art and makes life as life as life. In a recursive
        act, the
        kōan makes no sense, yet through the repetition of looking, seeing and not seeing, you find what isn't there.
        And
        through that act, you know what can't be and yet must be. A logical option that must and can't be. I must be
        the
        Jason
        that wrote this, but I also am the one who didn't. By doing so, the ghost of the superposition who did and
        didn't is
        true, yet physically they can't be. Art must be all that stands before you, yet it can not be; there is a
        ghost
        that
        both is and isn't the art that is the true artwork and yet still cannot be.

        As I search for an ending, I know my pathway through this piece leads to one. Though, there is also
        anuncountable setof I's who wrote to one without an end. To live is to choose knowing that you are both the
        one
        who travels the pathwayand the one who didn't; from your own perspective, you see only one Ch'ien, and yet
        there
        are many more hidden in thewalls. Maybe there is an I who isn't writing this now, who is sitting in Greece
        with
        my father, we're talking aboutnothing and everything. I know that for me right now, that is an impossibility
        in
        so many painfully different ways. Yet, I know that I could be experiencing that right now, mapping a way back
        different paths taken, events being different,lives different. Through knowing that fact might just be true,
        well, that brings me a sense of sadness that it isn't methere, but going deeper, I find joy that we're there
        together in some way; neither one of us so far apart at one level,on another, the space is unimaginable. I see
        him who is I, knowing his eyes are soft and his heart is in the right place; Enjoy the joy you didn't know you
        should treasure. May your joy leak through the superposition of him that is us all while also being none.
