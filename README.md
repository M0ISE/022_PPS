# The personal Portfolio website for Jason Moisiadis
My personal website for 2022

Hello I'm Jason, i'm an Interaction Designer and I am creating a website for me to show off my work.

the site is made with blood sweet and jquery. 
Supported by the eassy structer of skelliton css.

You're welcome to have a look through and still some of my janky coding ideas.

Jason as an Experience Designer, is grounded in the principles of UX and Service Design, Jason works to bring an Design Thinking led approach to the projects they work with. Creatively opening up the problem through detailed User-Research to find the underlying concepts driving the problem, so they can spend their time working on building the right solutions. 

As an Immersive Designer Jason has focused in on Designing Immersive Experiences that aren’t obsessively reliant on Screens and Headsets. Instead they use Sensemaking Principles to work on all the customer’s senses and Cognitive Processes to aid in creating a deeper sense of immersion within a given experience. Jason is particularly passionate about Narrative Design, How it can be used to design engaging levels within Games and Immersive Experiences that users love and come back to.  Yet, Narrative Design can also be used as a novel tool to examine, and solve larger scale Wicked Problems; especially when combined with Modelling and Simulation. 

They love to work collaboratively within teams of Designers and other Professionals. Taking into account each other’s strengths and weaknesses and biases to build a team that works effectively and efficiently to critically analyse and solve problems together.
